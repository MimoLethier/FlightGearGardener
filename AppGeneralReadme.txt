FlightGearGardener - Version 02 - Jan 2018

====================

1. Purposes

The global purpose behind this Application was to use JavaFX to produce (yet another) asynchronous 
downloader for FlightGear Terrasync Scenery, a kind of light version of the well known TerraMaster 
tool, but based on the DNS/HTTP download principles, and using JavaFX instead of Swing. 

This is just a first trial, to be regarded as a reasonably usable output of a coding exercize... 
(covering controlled synchronization only for TERRAIN, OBJECTS and AIRPORTS, with additional but 
limited support for browsing a Terrasync server and downloading (piecewise!) Building, Models, 
Pylons..., pretty anything found there, indeed). 

It has evolved as a learning workbench, for me and possibly other Java developers interrested 
in geting some grip over things like geographic data handling (although there is no use of 
advanced technology like GeoTools)... Considering that the most time-consuming operations are 
Network and MMI interactions, considering also the asynchronous (out-of-flight) nature 
of this application, design and coding were focused mainly on comfortable use, intuitive 
interactions, and readable, reusable internal structures, not maximum speed (using systematically 
.dirindex files and SHA-1 signatures is however delivering quite satisfying results).

While certainly not a model of Java OO development (using less than 25 specific classes clearly 
points in the direction of a persistent "procedural" bias), and possibly for that reason too,
I see FlightGearGardener also as a (very humble!) celebration of James Goslin's marvelously 
clever, robust, expressive, predictable, well-balanced and, all in one, pleasurable creation...


2. Usage and rights

Beyond the java code written specifically for FlightGearGardener, there are only four externaly
sourced stuff:
	- the Java API provided by the jdk1.8.0_102 and Netbeans 8.2, of course;
	- NaturalEarth Shapefiles (ne_110m_admin_0_countries) : 
			http://www.naturalearthdata.com/about/terms-of-use/ ;
	- Brian Wellington's dnsJava-2.1.7 library : 
			http://www.dnsjava.org/dnsjava-current/README ;
	- Thomas Diewald work on reading ShapeFiles :
			http://thomasdiewald.com/blog .
	
Concerning Thomas Diewald, his work was effectively the main avenue enabling me to understand quickly 
how to handle and render ESRI ShapeFiles in Java. Though I eventually did not use his (much more 
ambitious and fully engineered) code, it's a pleasure to recognize his seminal impact. Moreover, 
his blog is a real delight for those loving computer graphics and algorithmic fancies rendering...

Obviously, FlightGearGardener, being a public-garden hobby, does not provide any more
warranties about anything. 

Since human intellectual productions mostly result from encountering, understanding, and 
reassembling other human intellectual productions, there is no constraint put on reusing 
FlightGearGardener specific code and so keeping the wheels turning, as long as this does not 
concur to freedom limitation, ecological or human harm, or commercial profits.


3. Install

The whole thing is split in two subsets:
	A. FG_GardenerV00.zip, which includes the following folders:
		- Config
			contains a default/template config file: FLIGHTGEARGardener\sysContext.xml;
		- DefaultTerrasync
			contains a default (void) Terrasync folder, to receive downloaded data in case of 
			"minimal" configuration;
		- FG_bin
			contains the executable (FlightGearGardener.jar) and a group of seven run_time library files. 
			FG_bin may be freely moved or renamed, but its content must be kept unchanged;
		- ReadMe
			contains... readme files (this one included), and a short Doc about sysContext properties;
		- Shapefiles
			contains the three NaturalEarth shapefiles used for countries projection;
		- Z_Javapps
			a folder containing the file relocation template, z_Launchpad.xml;
		- ZZ-logs
			a (void) folder to receive logs in the "minimal" config case...
			
		This set is intended for FlightGearGardener users who don't want reading/modifying the java code.
		The easiest way to run/test it is to download the zip and "extract here" in your UserHome folder:
		this will create a FG_GardenerV00 folder containing all you need to proceed with "minimal"
		configuration (see ConfigReadMe for the few mandatory changes still to do before run). Of course 
		customized install is supported, reading further in the same ConfigReadMe....
		
	B. Sources, which contains the java source code. Note that to compile those sources, you will
		need the libraries grouped in the FG_bin\lib folder found in A. above (and support for 
		javaFX API, of course).
		Sources are structured as follows:
		- Package gardenAccessMain: includes the .css STYLE, .fxml GUI and the .java MAIN and CTRL files.
			As expected, the CTRL file is the "controller", handling all MMI interactions/events, and 
			MAIN is the javaFX Stage loader;
		- Package gardenDrawer: includes objects and methods used to render the ShapeFile data and 
			display the World projection map. It uses an never shown Canvas, managed excusively internally
			to render the Countries borders, then extract images of the needed parts for display. 
			The first step is always projecting the whole World map in the "Focusing..." Tab, and 
			waiting mouse clicks somewhere in the map. Such click will define a 46째x46째 zone to be used as 
			the user-selected focus Region; clicking then the "Apply zoom" button will move the user to the 
			"Downloading..." Tab, where the Region has been rendered as a 1째x1째 grid... The user must then 
			use a Directory chooser to specify her/his selected target Terrasync folder; using this,
			FlighGearGardener will paint the grid cells to reflect the sync freshness state, and give access
			to the various Action buttons...;
		- Package gardenLoader: includes technical agents used for synchronization and downloads;
		- Package gardeningObjects: includes a Constant dictionary, GridCellMatrix, TileSpray,
			TileSyncStates..., gadgets quite usefull to get the gardening job done;
		- Package gardeningThread: objects used to deliver more time-consuming operations in a separate 
			thread. Note that this is done primarilly to ensure MMI animation, reflecting the process
			progres, and avoiding freeze perception: there is NO effort made to support parallel 
			downloads, for instance - action buttons are in fact disabled till Task conclusion.
